      "   Description\n",
      "       This command is similar to npm help install, except it's meant to be used\n",
      "       in automated environments such as test platforms, continuous integration,\n",
      "       and deployment -- or any situation where you want to make sure you're\n",
      "       doing a clean install of your dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The main differences between using npm install and npm ci are:\n",
      "\n",
      "       •   The project must have an existing package-lock.json or npm-\n",
      "           shrinkwrap.json.\n",
      "\n",
      "       •   If dependencies in the package lock do not match those in\n",
      "           package.json, npm ci will exit with an error, instead of updating the\n",
      "           package lock.\n",
      "\n",
      "       •   npm ci can only install entire projects at a time: individual\n",
      "           dependencies cannot be added with this command.\n",
      "\n",
      "       •   If a node_modules is already present, it will be automatically\n",
      "           removed before npm ci begins its install.\n",
      "\n",
      "       •   It will never write to package.json or any of the package-locks:\n",
      "           installs are essentially frozen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "       NOTE: If you create your package-lock.json file by running npm install\n",
      "       with flags that can affect the shape of your dependency tree, such as\n",
      "       --legacy-peer-deps or --install-links, you must provide the same flags to\n",
      "       npm ci or you are likely to encounter errors. An easy way to do this is\n",
      "       to run, for example, npm config set legacy-peer-deps=true\n",
      "       --location=project and commit the .npmrc file to your repo.\n",
      "\n",
